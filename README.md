The original BrickPi API can be found through https://github.com/DexterInd/BrickPi3 and more specifically, this file: https://github.com/DexterInd/BrickPi3/blob/master/Software/Python/brickpi3.py on GitHub as well. Our `utils.brick` is a wrapper library on top of this `brickpi3` api, which is already on every BrickPi robot when you get it. You don't need to install anything. You may use either our `utils.brick` wrapper library or `brickpi3`, but again, we simplified and added many utility funcitons to `utils.brick` to make programming easier.
